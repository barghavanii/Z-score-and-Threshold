# Z-score-and-Threshold
Discussion: The optimal threshold is equal or less than 2.0, in the case of Z score variance is close to the standard normal distribution. In contrast, the threshold is over 2.0 in the case of Z score variance is more than 1.0, and then by using ordinary threshold 2.0, it cannot point out abnormality.
