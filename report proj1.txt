as It can be seen this comparison was occured between 3+ group so this is the ain resone why we went for ANOVA (called F ) 
instead of Z or T score 

Compare the means from two or more
groups to see whether they are so far
apart that the observed differences
cannot all reasonably be attributed to
sampling variability

H0=ùúá(Less than HS) = ùúá(HS) = ùúá(Jr Coll) = ùúá(Bachelor's)=ùúá(Graduate) which means average age of people whithin 5 groups are equal
F-Value = determines the ratio of between groups variance to groups variance which means (the larger the ratio , the more likely it is that the groups have different means (reject H0 ))
conditions:
1. The observations should be independent within and between groups
   As it can be seen these 5 groups are indepent because everyone was categories accoridng to their lates education status
2. The observations within each group should be nearly normal

3. The variability across the groups should be about equal
 the degree of freedome(dfG) for this test is number of groups(5 groups) - 1=4
 the degree of total (dfT)is total number of observations which is 1160 (after drop Null value from the observation )-1 = 1159
 so --> F(4,1160)=4.459536 
 the degree of Error (dfE) is dfT-dfG= 1159-4=1155
 Sum of squares between groups, SSG which is calculated 4054.648874  
 sum of squars of Error is 262534.002678   
 so sum squares of total is SSE+SSG=266588.651
 Mean Square Error :
 Mean square error is calculated as sum of squares divided by the degrees of
freedom SO:
 MSG=SSG-dfG=4054.648874/4=1013.662219  
 MSE=SSE/dfE=262534.002678   /1155=227.302167 

Test statistic, F value
‚Ä¢ As we discussed before, the F statistic is the ratio of the between group and
within group variability so it is ratio between MSG/MSE=1013.662219/227.302167=4.459536


p-value is the probability of at least as large a ratio between the ‚Äúbetween
group‚Äù and ‚Äúwithin group‚Äù variability, if in fact the means of all groups are
equal. It‚Äôs calculated as the area under the F curve, with degrees of freedom
dfG and dfE, above the observed F statistic.
stats.f(dfG,dfE).sf(f)=stats.f(4,1155).sf(4.459536)=0.001401503417176837
the P_value is less than 0.05 so reject H0. The data provide convincing evidence that at least one mean is different from but we cannot say which 

conclusion :
The data provide convincing evidence that the average age in every EducationStatus is different for at least one group

And now in order to answer which means differ we go for t_test_pairwise()
